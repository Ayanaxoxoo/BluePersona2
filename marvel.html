    One of the ways I worked on my empathy skills was by 
    exploring every aspect of my client's health and considering ways she might
     not only improve her health care well-being but also her pitching abilities. 
     During this unit we both had a change to develop a deeper understanding of the relationship
      between physical well-being and work performance. I was able to customize exercises that not only improved her 
      general fitness but also sharpened 
      the particular muscles (which will be explained more in 
      detail later) and abilities necessary for a successful pitch thanks to her empathetic approach.

        We talked about more than just activities as we also talked about her health goals.
         One example is when she stretched her hamstrings or went on runs and bike rides in her own time, 
        she expressed how comfortable she was during these activities and what difficulties she was having 
        (incase she missed one of the week's activities, she was honest which is an important skill to have).
